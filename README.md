Welcome to the PRNU Predictor GitHub repository! This project aims to identify the original device used to capture images by leveraging the PRNU (Photo-Response Non-Uniformity) values. The PRNU values serve as unique fingerprints for different imaging devices, making it possible to determine the device that captured a particular image.

## Background

The idea behind this project is inspired by the research conducted by the Politecnico di Milano, available in their repository [prnu-python](https://github.com/polimi-ispl/prnu-python/tree/master/prnu). We built upon their work and expanded the functionality to create a user-friendly web application for predicting the device that captured an image based on its PRNU signature.

## Features

- Predicts the original device used to capture an image by analyzing its PRNU values.
- Supports various imaging devices (Training the model further to support more devices is always welcomed ðŸ˜‰):
  - FrontCamera-GalaxyA13-225951
  - FrontCamera-GalaxyA13-225952
  - Logitech Brio210500
  - Logitech Brio210504
  - Logitech Brio210506
  - Logitech C50596011268
  - Logitech C50596011268_2
  - Logitech C50596011268_3
  - Nikon_Zfc
  - RÃ¼ckCamera-GalaxyA13-225951
  - RÃ¼ckcamera-GalaxyA13-225952
- Deployed web application accessible at [https://prnu-predictor.streamlit.app/](https://prnu-predictor.streamlit.app/).
- Docker support for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PRNU Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prnu-predictor.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd prnu-predictor
   python3.10 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the web application:
   
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   
4. Access the web application by opening `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Docker Support

The PRNU Predictor also provides Docker support for easy deployment. To build and run the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t prnu-predictor .
   ```
  
2. Run the Docker container:
   
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 prnu-predictor
   ```
   
4. Access the web application by opening `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.
